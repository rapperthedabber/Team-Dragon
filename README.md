 # Description 

  This application is a mini social media app inspired by twitter. Users can sign up or login in order to make a post. Also, the application also renders quotes from a anime API in the footer of the website everytime a user reloads the page. Everytime a user logs in, the user is able to see all the users within our database. 
   ## login page
   This is the login/authentication screen. The same form can be used to make a new user as well!

  ## Main web page
  You can see every single user in our database after you are either logged in or signed up!
